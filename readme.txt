= Get Sauce to let your customers shop your Instagram feed =

★★★ Sauce is an Approved Instagram App ★★★

= Sauce is... =
...so easy to use that it’s hard to explain. We made it really, really simple for people to make shoppable, embeddable Instagram galleries, catalogues & lookbooks from their feed and put whatever they want in it. Fashion, design, art, extreme sports, kids, jewelry. Sauce is a gazillion different shoppable Instagram catalogues, filled with literally whatever.

= Are you losing precious Instagram traffic and sales? =
65% of Instagram users use their feeds to discover new brands and for online shopping inspiration. With Sauce, you can make Instagram become your next customer acquisition, sales pipeline, making it easy for your followers to buy the product they see in your Instagram posts.

= Don’t know which are your best performing images? - Still using bit.ly? =
Successful brands know that the connection between sight and desire is visceral, primal and not to be ignored. But, most content creators don’t, it’s left to guesswork, or, at least they have never had a way to clearly identify which images work for them and which ones don’t. Unquestionably, the majority of sellers using Instagram as a marketing channel find it difficult to identify the images that prompt their visitors to come to their shops yet alone the ones that compel them to buy. If you’ve been thinking about this or, perhaps even attempted to use, say, a bit.ly link in your Instagram bio in order to have some basic tracking for your Instagram clicks, then this thing is for you.

= You already know this thing works =
see our [getting started guide](https://help.addsauce.com/en/collections/186568-getting-started)

1. Connect to Instagram to automatically fetch images from your feed
2. Link images with your products using Sauce’s plug-n-play WooCommerce store integration. Now, anyone can shop your products.
3. Embed shoppable galleries and carousels directly in your store or, if you prefer copy & paste your personalized URL to link to your Sauce page in your bio link.
4. Your customers and your orders will appear in your shop dashboard, exactly as you’d expect. Purchases made as a result of a customer seeing your Instagram images are tracked all the way to the checkout so that you can see your best performing images and the purchases they inspired.
Customers no longer need to hunt down the things they saw in your instagram feed in your store as each Instagram image is now linked with a ‘Buy’ button.
