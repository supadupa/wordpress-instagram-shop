== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin add to WordPress/WooCommerce? =

Wordpress - this plugin makes it easy for you to make use of your Sauce shoppable embed on any page or blog post of your website. You’ll see a button added to the toolbar of the page editor, which when clicked, allows you to select the Sauce Embed type (i.e Grid, Stacked or, Carousel) you would like, and then inserts the corresponding shortcode into the content.

WooCommerce - if you are using the WooCommerce plugin for your store, this plugin will automatically insert the Sauce Conversion code on the 'Thank you' page, displayed once an order has been placed. This allows you to track your customers’ conversion data on your Sauce Analytics page, providing insight into your stores performance, and the impact of media used via Sauce on your store’s success.
